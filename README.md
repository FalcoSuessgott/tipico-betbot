# tipico-betbot
Tipico betbot, which fetches football predictions from [boggio-analytics](https://boggio-analytics.com/fp-api/), parses them and places them with [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) on [Tipico](https://www.tipico.de/en/online-sports-betting/).

Boggio-Analytics claims to have a success rate of 70-75% which should, theoretically end in a certain period, in profit.
